  "130 years of history...need I say more..", 
  "I got it in a cut price deal of 500/- which is quite cheap.", 
  "Packaging was quite ordinary and the SAK has lot of fingerprints on the cellidor body. But no complaints about the quality of the knife. Its original. Need not worry if you encounter some fluid on opening the blades. Its just mineral oil.", 
  "A word of advice though, if your blades are too tight then instead of forcing them out again and again, give them a warm water bath and reapply machine oil. They will work just fine.", 
  "Another discovery, nowhere does it mention about a small hole on the cellidor body just over the cork screw. It is for safety pin which can be stowed inside. Too bad that victorinox does not provide one.", 
  "Rarely you get a chance to point out poor packaging from Amazon. I had to just tear a small part of package and product fell down. Packaging was poor but product was fine. Although the product appeared little unclean or used types with small scratches and marks on it. I am good with its price tag of 700rs.", 
  "If I hadn't had previous good experience with Amazon, I would have given two stars.", 
  "My son was very happy with the product.", 
  "The product cam on time.", 
  "The quality is much better than any imitation brands I have seen even though the quality is no longer as good as it used to be 20 years back. I think Victorinox is also falling victim to the universal cost-cutting malady rampant in every manufacturing unit in the world.", 
  "However, I still consider it the best in it's segment.", 
  "I ordered for the black(amazon fulfilled) one but received a blue one. This kind of mistake or callousness is unacceptable.", 
  "Regarding the quality, I would say it is definitely original since I have kind of experience. The only down side of the product is the plastic/fiber handle would easily get scratch marks witch was not the case with my older 7 function victorinox or the rescue tool since handles of these knives were mat-finished.", 
  "Pros:", 
  "The sharpness of the Swiss blades needs no introduction.", 
  "Very handy and useful to carry around.", 
  "The black body looks great (cooler than the red model)", 
  "All the utilities comes useful sometime or the other.", 
  "Cons:", 
  "Very sharp knife. Needs careful handeling.", 
  "Wish the price would be lower.", 
  "It took a little time for the product to arrive.... It seems the courier service had trouble locating my place. I Made a couple of calls for  the next 4 days to the customer service, after which they responded(Main reason why i am giving one star less). But when I received it all my disappointments disappeared. I love my swiss army knife.... Proud of it!", 
  "The finish could have been better. It did not look like a factory-fresh piece.", 
  "Feels like an used product...please dont buy...later you feel like using the swiss army knife made years ago..i didnt order for an antique i ordered for a new product"
