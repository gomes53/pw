  "Good looking belt..got multiple compliments..so here is what I conclude-", 
  "Looks- 5 of 5 (great texture)", 
  "Material- 5 of 5 (looks durable)", 
  "comfort- 4 of 5 (thickness of the belt is a little extra, hence it becomes a little uncomfortable when u wrap around. also you need to have a little large holders to stick this in)", 
  "overall- its a good product", 
  "Just bought it. It's good quality design quite nice but worst part is that cloudtail(seller) gives Mrp as 1995 whereas the actual Mrp is 1495. They are doing Manipulative Trade Practices and amazon has no clue. This is not the standard amazon follows. It's Cheating actually.", 
  "Look and feel of the belt is the best ever, holes for adjusting are across the length of the belt which is incorporated in the design of the belt, you will be noticed instantly by your friends. Note for ordering add minimum 4 inches to your pant waist size.", 
  "The product came well packaged and without any damages. Its more on the darker side and fits well. Its got a rich look about it.", 
  "Though the product is great I was wondering how it is available at such a low cost. When I opened the pack I realised the product itself is 3 years old!! Date of manufacture was Feb/2012. Though it might be old I could not find any dullness or loss of life due to dead stock.", 
  "Earlier I purchased the maddox brown belt at the rate of Rs 1195 so now I need one more if you could arrange the same at the same price pl.intimate me this time I want maddox brown mens leather", 
  "belt 36\"", 
  "Excellent purchase. In fact I have bought this the second time around & have even bought one for my dad.", 
  "Awesome.... belt. Loved it.", 
  "Guys, the FOSSIL company has stopped the production of belts recently.", 
  "So go for dis belt....uh have made an smart investment.", 
  "But while wearing it.... do not wear it too TIGHT, otherwise the joints in the belt would tear.", 
  "Totally worth. Looks something different.", 
  "The best mens belt ever used.  The color is a little darker than what appears in the image. I totally love the belt. Neatly braided and seems like it will stay for long in my wardrobe."
