  "The ordering and delivery from Amazon was really smooth. I bought this for my brother and had it gift wrapped and for some reason, Amazon decided to waive charges for gift wrapping - awesome!", 
  "About the watch:", 
  "Pros & features I liked:", 
  "1. Light weight", 
  "2. Display is very clear and legible even in bright sunlight", 
  "3. Indiglo brightens up the display sufficiently to read in dark", 
  "4. 30 lap stopwatch. The start/split timer is located prominently and is easy to press when running and without having to look at the watch", 
  "5. Easy to store/delete the workout timings", 
  "6. Timer with repeat option", 
  "7. Optional hourly chimes", 
  "Cons:", 
  "1. The strap seems a bit long. People with thin wrists may have to get a couple of additional holes punched to get a snug fit", 
  "2. Only a single alarm and a single timer is available", 
  "3. Apart from the Start/Split and Indiglo buttons, the other 3 buttons have a bit less travel. This makes you want to (sometimes) double check to make sure you have pressed those buttons", 
  "Conclusion: If you are looking for a basic sports watch within Rs. 1500, this is probably the best bet and worth the money", 
  "a good product from Timex for all the outdoor activities .", 
  "cons:", 
  "the dial is really small for a slightly big wrist .", 
  "I appreciate the prompt delivery from amazon.", 
  "Truly amazing product, delivery on time, I use it for under water swimming to till 20M, Value for money product", 
  "Good product", 
  "Good."
