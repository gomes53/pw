  "Wish the price would be lower.", 
  "Had ordered the product on 31st October under the guaranteed delivery scheme of 2 days. Got the delivery on 12th October after following up with the customer care relentlessly for one week. The paper box containing the knife was already open and the knife had scratches indicating prior use and oiled something I know isn't done by Victorinox. The knife looked beautiful otherwise especially with imprints. Top notch quality from Victorinox yet again. I have 15 tool ecoline that I have carrying everyday therefore wanted to replace that with a classic", 
  "Its a very good knife. My first sak, as my previous experience with this type  was cheap and chinese, but have used a leatherman before. Good blade, sharp. Saw is also very good. The key ring makes taking the hook difficult, but not impossible. a bit thicker than the other models and a nice sold feel. Knife could be in the middle layer though", 
  "my first swiss knife. awesome. really sharp. a little tight to open as i dont have good nails. all in all its great."
